# MiniML: CS51 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for CS51, Harvard's second introductory computer science course, focusing on abstraction and functional programming through the lens of the language OCaml. The project implements an OCaml-esque language, MiniMl, and can implement lexical and dynamic scoping (for more information on my implementation, refer to writeup.pdf).

Run Instructions:

* compile with ```make all```
* launch MiniMl with ```./miniml.byte```
* run unit tests with ```./tests.byte```
